Project description:

My website is a fictional CV for Sonic The Hedgehog. He is one of my favorite video game character and he made my whole childhood.
On the Homepage you can find a preview of the entire website and buttons to access the other pages. My second Page is a Experiences Page and it contains a sort of timeline of every event he went through.
The third page is a Page that explains and show every Qualities Sonic has. The website is responsive to mobile devices and contains a hamburger menu. It  also conatins lots of animations.

Hamburger Menu:

The only code I used from extern links is for the hamburger menu. I also modified the code to fit my website. There is a part of the code in the header in every html file and a part in every css file.

Grid:

I used CSS grid for my website and I used the grid structure that we used in "Exercise 12 - CursorUp" available on Canvas.
