            <h1>1991: The start of Everything</h1>
            <h4>1991 was when it all began. I zipped onto the scene to save innocent animals from Robotnik's crazy contraptions. Green Hills Zone? Iconic. Chaos Emerlads? Collected. Speed? Unmatched.</h4>

            <h2>1992: A friend on the Journey</h2>
            <p>Things were getting tougher, and then I met Tails. He was just this little fox with two tails spinning around like a helicopter.</p>

            <h2>1993: Race Through Time</h2>
            <p>This year was... different. Somehow, Robotnik got his hands on a machine that let him mess with time itself. To fix things, I had to run faster than ever before, traveling between the past, present, and future to stop Robotnik from turning paradise into a wasteland.</p>

            <h2>1994: Knuckles</h2>
            <p>Ah, Knuckles. At first, he was a pain. Robotnik tricked him into thinking I was the bad guy, so he kept getting in my way. But when the truth came out, he turned out to be a pretty solid dude. Stubborn as a rock, but reliable. Together, we stopped Robotnik’s plans again, and for a moment, it felt like we’d finally won.</p>

            <h2>1999: A New Dimension</h2>
            <p>Everything changed when I discovered new worlds, cities full of people, temples with ancient secrets, and creatures beyond anything I’d ever seen. I met Chaos, this water-like being, and Shadow, a rival with a mysterious past. It was overwhelming, but it reminded me why I keep moving forward.</p>

            <p>Shadow... He wasn’t just a rival; he was someone carrying a burden I couldn’t imagine. For all his strength, he had this deep sadness. Fighting alongside him, I realized we weren’t so different. We both wanted to protect what mattered, even if we had different ways of doing it.</p>

            <p>There was a time I felt like I couldn’t catch a break. Everything I tried seemed to go wrong. It was frustrating, like I was tripping over my own feet. But even when the world felt heavy, I kept running. That’s all I know how to do.</p>

            <p>Things started to feel right again. I stopped worrying so much about what people expected and just focused on the joy of running, exploring, and helping wherever I could. The world was still full of surprises, and I was ready for all of them.</p>

            <p>I never imagined I’d end up in the movies. Suddenly, everyone knew who I was, even people who’d never seen a loop-de-loop before. It was weird, but kind of awesome. Seeing people cheer for me again? That was the best.</p>
